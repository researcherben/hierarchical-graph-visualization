There are many graph representations, e.g.,
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML>
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language>
* <http://jsongraphformat.info/> and <https://github.com/jsongraph/json-graph-specification>

For a detailed review, see "Unravelling Graph-Exchange File Formats" in <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02781.pdf>.
Specific to this repo's focus on hierarchical graphs, see table III on page 11. 

What is relevant for this effort: 
* support for hierarchical property graphs, e.g., GraphML or Dot
* support for schema validation, e.g., JSON or XML
* support for graph manipulation using Python and C++ 
* support for visualization of the hierarchical property graph
